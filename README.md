ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Python 3.10+
pip installed

âœ… 1.  Create and activate a virtual environment

In your terminal (# macOS/Linux):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  


Troubleshooting:
Every Python virtual environment (venv, conda, pyenv, etc.) has its own packages.

For example:

If you run pip install yfinance inside one terminal tab or VS Code,
But then run your app from another terminal tab using a different environment,
That new one wonâ€™t have yfinance â€” so it fails.
Check your current Python path:
which python

Then check where pip is installing packages:
which pip

If python and pip point to different paths, theyâ€™re not using the same environment.

âœ… 2. Install dependencies like FastAPI, Uvicorn and yfinance

In your terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt

OR

pip install fastapi uvicorn yfinance

Globaly:
pip install --user yfinance

You can check it installed correctly

pip list

âœ… 3. Activate your virtual environment

If you have a virtual environment (like venv), activate it:
In your terminal (# for macOS/Linux):
source venv/bin/activate  

âœ… 4. Run the FastAPI server

In your terminal:
uvicorn main:app --reload

comments:
app = the FastAPI instance
--reload = auto-reload on changes (for dev)


TEST

âœ… 1. Install the required packages (if not yet installed):
pip install pytest httpx pytest-asyncio

âœ… 2 Run the test:
pytest test_main.py
